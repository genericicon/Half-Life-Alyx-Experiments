# Half-Life-Alyx-Experiments
Large amount of experimental vscripts that I've made in Half Life Alyx

Note: Much of this code is a mess

Metrocop and citizens require certain assets and prefabs for each one
  you need to have your own custom sounds for citizens or metrocops, additionally you need to replace the original death sounds of combine grunts/captains with a blank sound.
The door breacher script will only work for doors the first time. I will be uploading a version that breaks doors off the hinges later on.

If you end up using this code, I would like to see what you made with it!
